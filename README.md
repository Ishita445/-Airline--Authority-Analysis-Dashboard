## Airline Authority Analysis Dashboard

**Airline Authority Analysis Dashboard** is a Power BI project that explores flight delay patterns across different airline authorities. It delivers time-based insights to support operational improvements and data-driven decision-making in the aviation industry.

---

### Project Overview

The dashboard provides a multi-dimensional analysis of average flight delays on a **weekly, monthly, and yearly** basis. Designed for stakeholders in airline operations, it enables easy filtering, comparison, and visualization of delay trends across airlines and timeframes.

### Key Features

#### Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Removed irrelevant and duplicate records
* Standardized column types and date formats
* Built a clean, well-structured data model using Power Query

#### Dashboard Development

* Created a multi-page dashboard with intuitive navigation
* Added 4 slicers for filtering by airline, authority, date, and region
* Included comparison visuals to assess performance across time intervals

#### Advanced Power BI Implementation

* Used DAX to calculate dynamic KPIs, YoY/MoM changes, and running averages
* Implemented drill-through pages for detailed authority-level breakdowns
* Integrated tooltips and bookmarks for enhanced user interactivity
* Applied conditional formatting and data-driven color logic for better insights

#### Data Storytelling

* Designed the dashboard to present clear trends and root-cause signals
* Helped identify peak delay periods and underperforming airlines
* Communicated insights in a way that's accessible to both technical and non-technical users
